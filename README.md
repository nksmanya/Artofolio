# Artopolio: An Art Portfolio

Artopolio is a full-stack personal art portfolio with a neon-cyberpunk aesthetic.  
It allows a single administrator (you!) to showcase drawings and paintings, manage content with full CRUD functionality, and categorize everything with searchable tags.


## Tech Stack

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js  
- **ORM:** Prisma  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase)  
- **Image Hosting:** Cloudinary  


## Core Features

- **Admin-Only Access:** Securely locked down so only the designated admin can log in and manage content.
